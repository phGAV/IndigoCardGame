# IndigoCardGame
JetBrains Academy [project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/214) to study Kotlin. A simple command-line card game called Indigo, player vs computer

## The game rules are easy:

- Four cards are placed face-up on the table
- Six cards are dealt to each player
- The players take turns in playing cards. If the card has the same suit or rank as the topmost card, then the player wins all the cards on the table
- When both players have no cards in hand, go to step 2 unless there are no more remaining cards in the card deck
- The remaining cards on the table go to the player who won the cards last. In the rare case where none of the players win any cards, then all cards go to the player who played first.
